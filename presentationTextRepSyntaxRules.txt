TEXT REPRESENTATION FEATURES

Objects:
| presentation
|   | title: string
|   | cuecard
|   |    | point: string
|   |    | details
|   |    |   | item: string

Non-primitive objects:
The "presentation", "cuecard", and "details" objects contain other objects, and 
are therefore non-primitive. These start with "\begin{...}[...]" and end with "\end{...}"
tokens. The type of the non-primitive will go in between the curly braces ("{<type>}") 
after "\begin" and "\end". The \begin token is optionally ended with a series of 
attributes, each enclosed by square brackets (e.g. "[color=pink]"). For now, 
nesting non-primitive objects of the same type is not supported.

Tokens and keywords:
The text representation is broken down into tokens, delimited by "\" characters. 
They mark the start and end of non-primitive objects, and contain primitive objects.
Which of those function a particular token has, will be denoted by the keyword it 
starts with. Keywords include "begin", "end", "title", "point", and "item".

Primitive objects:
The "title", "point", and "item" objects are primitive, as they contain text only.
These are marked by keywords of the same name. For example, a point object will 
begin with a "\point", and will continue until the next keyword is reached. The 
keyword is optionally followed by a series of attributes, each enclosed with 
square brackets. Regarding where text will be rendered, the text from the 
"\point ..." tokens will be rendered on the front of cuecards, and the text from 
the "\item ..." tokens will be rendered on the back of cuecards.

Comments:
Use "%". The "%" and the remaining characters on the same line will be ignored 
by the parser.

Text to be rendered on cuecards:
In the text contained in a primitive object, parts enclosed by "$" symbols will 
be highlighted when the cuecard is rendered (the "$" characters themselves will 
be dropped). An escape character, to render "\", "%", and "$" as visible cuecard 
text is not supported at the moment.

Object attributes:
- cuecard
    - color: 
    - endpause: true (default) or false
- cuecard.point
    - color:
- cuecard.details.item
    - color: 

SYNTAX RULES   

\begin{presentation}: 
    - must be followed by "\end{presentation}" at some point
    - cannot be followed by "\begin{presentation}"

\end{presentation}:
    - must be preceded by a "\begin{presentation}"
    - cannot be preceded by an "\end{presentation}"

The previous two points applies for "cuecard" and "details" objects too.

Any text outside the bounds demarcated by a set of "\begin{presentation}" and 
"\end{presentation}" will be ignored. For now, importing multiple presentations 
(parsing multiple sets of "\begin{presentation}" and "\end{presentation}" in a 
single text file) is not supported; only the first presentation in the file will 
be parsed.

Item objects are ended by the next "\item", or by "\end{cuecard}".

OMMMISSIONS ALLOWED IN TEXT REPRESENTATION AND HOW THEY ARE HANDLED

If a "\title ..." token is not included: default title is "unnamed".
If no cuecard objects are included: presentation will have and empty cuecard array.

If in a cuecard, a "\point ..." token is not inluded: default front string is "" (empty string).
If in a cuecard, a details object is not included: cuecard back will be empty.

If in a details object, no "\item..." is included: cuecard back will be empty
